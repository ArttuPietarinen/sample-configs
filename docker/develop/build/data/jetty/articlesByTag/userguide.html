	<a name="how-to-use-the-map-window"></a>How to Use the Map Window</h3>

<p> When you open the Oskari sample application, the map window opens  . It contains a world map in Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857) as a default map view. </p>
con
<p> On the left in the map window there is the Oskari menu. On the right there are tools. Tools on the right are from top down panning controls, coordinates and map orientation rectifier.</p>

<p> You can always reset the map window to this default view by clicking the center of the panning controls round symbol on top right corner of the map window. The same function is also available in the tools menu. Click the same symbol as in the center of panning controls, which has a curved arrow pointing to the left wall.

	<a name="basic-concepts-of-oskari-sample-application"></a>Basic Concepts of Oskari Sample Application</h3>

<p>  Oskari user works with map layers, map views and userâ€™s own datasets to create map views  . Map views, layers and datasets may be saved, published and shared.  Many of the functions in Oskari require login as a user. </p>

<p> 	&nbsp;</p> 

<h3>	
	<a name="map-views-and-layers"></a>How to Use the Map Window</h3>
	
<p>
	<strong>Move the map</strong> by clicking and dragging it or by clicking the panning controls in the top right corner. When you are looking for a specific object or location, use the Search function.</p>
<p>
Map view is what you see on the map window along with any tools and controls. Named map views are created by saving the current map view on the screen. You can save thematic map as map view. This will also preserve the underlying map layer of a given thematic map.</p>

<p> Map views are created from map layers stacked in certain order. You manipulate this stack and both the attributes and styles of the map layers.  The central tool to arrange stack is MAP LAYERS | Selected layers tab. This tool also defines the current stack of layers creating the current map view. Any operations in Oskari adding or deleting layers usually changes content of Selected layers tab and consequently the current map view. </p>

<p>  Map layers are the basic building blocks for map views. There are multiple ways to create or obtain map layers. Importing your data creates a map layer, creating a point, a line or an area allows you to create a new map layer for them or insert them into an existing layer. Creating a thematic map creates also a map layer or layers. There is New map layer function in MY DATA | Places to create new map layer.
Your Oskari may be also configured to receive map layers from service providers for use within Oskari. </p>

<p>Once you complete your work on layers and achieve a view you wanted, you can publish your results either as an embedded map or share a link to named map view.
</p>

<p>
You can move the map by clicking and anywhere on the map and dragging or by clicking the panning control arrows in the top right corner. </p>

<p>The scale selector to zoom in and out is located below panning controls on the right.  You can zoom in on the map by clicking the + control above scale selector or zoom out by clicking the - control under the scale selector. Alternatively click and drag the round switch on scale selector directly to the desired scale level. </p>

<p> You can see the location of the mouse pointer on the map by clicking the XY coordinates tool below scale. You can also pan map to specific coordinates and add markers with this tool. </p>

<p> Reset map north to back upwards by clicking the map orientation rectifier. Use Alt+Shift+Drag to rotate the map in the window.</p>

<p>
	<strong>The Map legend</strong> menu contains a description of the symbols used on the map layers.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The User guide</strong> menu contains this user guide. If you need more help, the i-symbol or more information link contain additional information.<br />
	Please note, that you can always reset the default settings and undo or redo any changes. These tools are located in the left margin below the menus (see Tools).</p>

  <a name="search"></a>Search</h3>
   
<p>
You can locate a place on the map either by name or by address. You can also center the map on location found. 
Enter the search text and click on the result. The map window will be focused immediately on the selected location.</p> 
   
<p> Metadata Search, if available, makes a search on the available metainformation from the map information service providers connected to Oskari. By default, there are no service providers connected to Oskari. Hence the Metadata search will not be available.
</p> 
 
<p> 	&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
  <a name="map-layers"></a>Map Layers</h3>

<p> There are two (2) tabs available in this tool. They are Search layers tab and Selected layers tab. </p> 

<h4>Search layers tab</h4>

<p> All the map layers available for use by default in current Oskari configuration are there In this tab.</p> 

<p> The available map layers and datasets are listed below the text search box.</p> 
 
<p> You can organize the map layers list either by data providers or by theme. You can select which by clicking the leftmost dropdown menu above the text search box. </p> 

<p> Alternatively, you can list the newest map layers, publishable layers, time series, vector layers and 3D layers by selecting the corresponding choice from the Show drop-down menu on the right.</p> 

<p> You can search map layers by a map layer name, a data provider name or a keyword by writing text to the search box.
All selected layers will show up in Selected layers tab and will update the map window.</p> 


<h4>Selected layers tab</h4>

<p> The Selected layers tab shows which datasets and map layers are currently displayed in the map view and in the map window.</p> 

<p> You can control what map layers are currently visible in the map window by changing content in the Selected layers tab. </p> 

<p> You can change the mutual order of the layers by dragging layers up and down, change the layer opacity, visibility and the styling of a layer if these changes are available for the given layer. Changes are reflected immediately in the map window.</p>

<p> The number on the right side of the Selected layers - text shows the number of selected map layers in the current map view in the map window.</p> 

<p>
  The contents of this tool, the list of layers, will change every time you make any change that will affect the map window.
</p>
